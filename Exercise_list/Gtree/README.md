{-
Consider a data structure Gtree for general trees, i.e. trees containg some data in each node, and a variable number of children. 

1. Define the Gtree data structure. 

2. Define gtree2list, i.e. a function which translates a Gtree to a list. 

3. Make Gtree an instance of Functor, Foldable, and Applicative.
